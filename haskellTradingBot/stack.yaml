# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
resolver: lts-3.20
# resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
#resolver: ghc-7.10.2
#
# The location of a snapshot can be provided as a file or url. Stack assumes
# a snapshot provided as a file might change, whereas a url resource does not.
#
# resolver: ./custom-snapshot.yaml
# resolver: https://example.com/snapshots/2018-01-01.yaml
#resolver:
#  url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/18/10.yaml

# User packages to be built.
# Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.
#
#packages:
#- .
#- Data.TALib
#   subdirs:
#   - auto-update
#   - wai
# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver.
# These entries can reference officially published versions as well as
# forks / in-progress versions pinned to a git hash. For example:
#
extra-deps: 
- github: elsen-trading/talib
