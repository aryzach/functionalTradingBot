Features:
MVP
	- OBV (take historical data / bars and just plug it right in)
	- make plot of raw historical data and OBV output overlay to understand pattern
	- use IBClient lib for Bars, but move historicalData functionality to own file (mimic provider.py)
Bugs
	- connect to IB without having to log out of IB and log back in
	- ibc.historicalData API gives runtime error sometimes. I think it's deterministic and has to do with improper param value combinations


Architecture:
	- publish IBClient lib to cloud so it's not a locally stored dependancy
	- refactor 
	- better workflow (programatically starting and running IB, repl session to test functions)
