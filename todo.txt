Features:
MVP
	- create a limit order
	- make a buy
	- wait some time
	- make a sell
	- OBV (take historical data / bars and just plug it right in)
	- make plot of raw historical data and OBV output overlay to understand pattern
Bugs
	- connect to IB without having to log out of IB and log back in
	- ibc.historicalData API gives runtime error sometimes. I think it's deterministic and has to do with improper param value combinations


Architecture:
	- publish IBClient lib to cloud so it's not a locally stored dependancy
	- move to more functional style and better code design
	- port to use ZIO 
	- better workflow (programatically starting and running IB, using / learning tmux, repl session to test functions)

Learning:
	- find book about concurrency (preferably in Scala / ZIO)
